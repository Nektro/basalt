# Basalt Documentation

Hello and welcome to Basalt! ðŸ‘‹ The following guides will go over function signatures and example on how to get started using Basalt today.

All Basalt libraries are ES2015+ Modules and are used with the syntax of
```js
import { ... } from "path/to/basalt/src/module.js";
```

## Getting Started
The preferred method of linking to Basalt Modules is currently with [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), specifically with the appropriate hash.
```js
// ie.
import { pipe } from "https://rawgit.com/nektro/basalt/<commit_hash>/src/pipe.js";
```

## Table of Contents
